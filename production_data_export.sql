Everything Urmi said made so much sense, on matters of love, and self. Urmi didn''t direct me, she simply told me what she was able to sense, and allowed me to derive my own path forward. As a therapist myself, I see the value in being a client who is gently shepherded towards her own path of realisation.

Urmi radiates confidence and power as an energy healer. Her smile is as gentle as her words, and yet when she speaks, it is a balance of firm intuition and meaning well for the person seeking her.

I was amazed at what all she could sense and state, from mere moments of focus on each person and her mindful presence in that short span of time. Her reading for me helped reinforce the qualities I thrive on, and my sense of individualism, and also showed me the path ahead to things that have been on my mind. She is not only very clear with what she says, but also has a beautiful and rather poetic way of expressing herself with the reading, which adds a wonderful extra element of nuance as you listen. I highly recommend her energy readings.', 5, '2025-10-06 10:16:30.007631'),

I wanted to thank you for the healing and  guidance you provided during the two healing sessions I had with you recently.

The handwriting analysis  was equally fascinating—it revealed aspects of my personality and thought process I had never considered before, yet felt instantly true.

It''s been a blessing to have been guided to you for healing and making me feel truly understood . I have shared your details to a few of my friends and wholeheartedly recommend  your work to anyone seeking deeper self-awareness and gentle, yet powerful guidance. Thank you again! 🙏🙏❤

Science and spirituality work hand in hand to create true balance.', 'For many, the words energy healing sound mystical — but at Claryntia, it''s deeply practical. Every thought creates a vibration, and our emotions affect our physiology. Science now validates what ancient wisdom always knew: the mind and body are connected.

Techniques like EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique), Ho''oponopono, and Graphotherapy work on releasing emotional energy stored within the subconscious. When combined with psychometric and behavioral assessments, this approach allows both measurable and energetic transformation.

Healing is not about choosing between science and soul — it''s about integrating both. When psychology meets energy work, the result is wholeness: a state where logic, emotion, and intuition flow together in harmony.', 'Urmi Dasgupta', NULL, '2025-10-06 10:02:20.630622'),

Learn how to manage burnout and realign your purpose using emotional awareness.', 'Modern professionals are driven, ambitious, and often exhausted. The pressure to perform leaves little room for pause — until burnout arrives. But burnout isn''t just mental fatigue; it''s a signal from your inner self asking for balance.

At Claryntia, we''ve helped countless professionals rediscover calm through clarity coaching and energy alignment. Emotional resilience doesn''t mean ignoring stress — it means building the ability to bounce back stronger.

Here are 5 simple practices to begin with:

Practice mindful pauses during your workday.

Learn to say "no" without guilt.

Identify emotional triggers behind workplace stress.

Reconnect with what truly gives your life meaning.

Seek mentorship or healing support when clarity fades.

Resilience is built not by pushing harder, but by aligning your purpose with peace.', 'Urmi Dasgupta', NULL, '2025-10-06 10:02:59.641862'),

Self-awareness is the first step toward clarity, peace, and purpose.', 'Most of us live on autopilot — reacting, rushing, repeating. We make choices based on old patterns rather than conscious intention. That''s why self-awareness is so powerful: it''s the key that unlocks every other form of growth.

At Claryntia, we use psychometric assessments, energy readings, and reflective coaching to help individuals see themselves clearly — their strengths, blind spots, and emotional patterns.

When you know yourself deeply, confusion fades. You stop comparing your path with others and begin walking your own.
Self-awareness isn''t self-criticism — it''s self-compassion guided by truth.

When you understand your energy, thoughts, and emotions, every decision — from career to relationships — begins to align naturally.', 'Urmi Dasgupta', NULL, '2025-10-06 10:03:28.531708'),
('2b1afe64-7877-4a85-9ad8-97e925411cc2', 'Simple Ways to Balance Your Mind, Body & Emotions', 'You don''t need hours of meditation to feel aligned. Small, consistent shifts in awareness can realign your energy and invite harmony into your day.', 'Energy alignment isn''t a distant concept — it''s a daily practice. It''s in how you breathe before responding to stress, how you listen without judgment, and how you reconnect with gratitude.

Our thoughts, emotions, and habits carry vibrations that influence our overall energy. When those vibrations are scattered, we feel drained or disconnected. Realignment can be as simple as:

Taking three conscious breaths before making a decision.

Journaling emotions rather than suppressing them.

Spending five minutes in silence or nature daily.

At Claryntia, we integrate energy readings and practical exercises to help you balance your frequency. When your energy aligns, everything — relationships, health, and clarity — begins to flow effortlessly.

Harmony isn''t found; it''s created through mindful, loving awareness each day.', 'Urmi Dasgupta', NULL, '2025-10-06 10:04:01.50657'),
('c68d0bc8-0964-425b-a91f-6f4ad6a6c4df', 'The Urgent Need for Career Counselling Today', 'In today''s fast-changing world, choosing the right career has become one of the toughest decisions for students and young professionals. Many end up in jobs that don''t match their strengths or interests, simply because they lacked proper guidance. Career counselling helps bridge this gap by bringing clarity, confidence, and direction. It''s not just about picking a job—it''s about discovering who you are, what you''re good at, and how to turn that into a fulfilling life. When individuals find their true path, it benefits not only them but the entire nation.', 'Choosing a career has never been more confusing. In the past, life followed a simple path from school to college to a stable job. Today, students face countless options, societal expectations, peer pressure, and the constant question of which career will pay well. Without guidance, many young people make choices that leave them frustrated, disengaged, or stuck in jobs that do not suit their true potential.

The Reality Young People Face

The modern world demands decisions that often feel too big for young minds. Students must pick streams and degrees at an early age. Parents influence choices based on social status or financial security rather than what the student is genuinely good at. The job market is changing every day, with technology and artificial intelligence creating new roles while old ones disappear. Many professionals realize years later that they have chosen the wrong path, wasting time and energy chasing something that does not bring them satisfaction.

How Career Counselling Helps

Career counselling is more than advice. It is a process that helps young people understand themselves, explore realistic options, and make confident decisions. A good career counsellor can help a student discover their strengths, interests, and values. They provide insight into industries and roles that match these qualities. They help young people weigh their options based on long-term growth, job satisfaction, and market realities. Most importantly, career counselling builds confidence. It allows students to make choices for themselves rather than simply following trends or pressure from others.

Why It Matters for Everyone

When young people choose careers that do not match their potential, the consequences go beyond the individual. Businesses lose talented employees, innovation slows, and the nation misses out on the full potential of its workforce. Career counselling is not just a personal service. It is an investment in society. Helping individuals find the right path creates happier people and a stronger, more productive community.

The Importance of Starting Early

Career guidance should begin long before the final years of school. When students are exposed to career counselling early, they learn to make choices based on clarity instead of confusion. They are guided by passion rather than peer pressure and by potential rather than fleeting trends. Early guidance equips them with the tools to navigate a complex world with confidence.

Conclusion

Career counselling is the compass that helps young people find their way in a confusing and ever-changing world. It empowers them to align their education and career choices with their true potential. When we prioritize career guidance, we create individuals who are more fulfilled and a society that benefits from their talent. Every student deserves the chance to make an informed choice. It is time to recognize career counselling as an essential part of education, not an optional extra.', 'Urmi Dasgupta', NULL, '2025-10-15 11:43:35.986734');
