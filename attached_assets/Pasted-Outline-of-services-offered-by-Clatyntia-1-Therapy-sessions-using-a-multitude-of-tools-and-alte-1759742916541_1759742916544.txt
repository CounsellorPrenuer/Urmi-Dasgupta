Outline of services offered by 'Clatyntia':

1. Therapy sessions using a multitude of tools and alternative healing modalities including subconscious mind reprogramming, EFT, Ho'ponopono, FCOA etc. 

Structure:
Session 1: Client case history intake & understanding key outcomes that the client is looking for. 
Session 2: Understand & heal Passive Aggressive Behaviour (PAB) related issues with parents/authority figures. All core issues in our life stem from our relationship with parents.
Session 3: Core void-related session. This will help identify what the client truly craves for, the core pattern the client is going through and why s/he remains stuck in a loop in their relationships, career, finances, health etc. 

Session 1-3 are the bedrock for any therapy.  They are diagnostic in nature and provide key indicators on core issues that need healing and how to proceed on the healing journey. 

Session 4 onwards: Focussing on the outcome that the client wishes to achieve. We shall explore what comes up naturally during the session and keep healing symptoms till we reach the root cause (accumulated in this or across lifetimes)

It takes about 6-10 sessions (depending how doop-rooted the issue is) to work towards achieving a specific outcome and attain sustainable healing. 

With each healing session, the client generally becomes more receptive and healing happens faster. 

Schedule: 1 session per week. Each session lasts 45 - 60 mins. Sometimes it might spill over to 75-90 mins. 

Charges: INR 3000 per 60 min session. 
INR 1500 for every extra 30 mins.
